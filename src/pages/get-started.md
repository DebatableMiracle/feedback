## Welcome to Feedback

Feedback is my public space for some personal thoughts, ideas and more technical articles. The idea is to build  a digital garden like structure to keep me from overthinking thoughts but also keep refining the articles and longer articles. 

If you’re new here, here is how I organize my writing and you can check out each sections accordingly:

### Logs

Short, raw, and frequent: Logs are my thinking-out-loud space. They are personal notes and fleeting thoughts I encounter day-to-day, published directly from my **Obsidian** vault. They aren't meant to be polished to be honest. The idea was to keep them simple exploration points for myself or those who are actually curious about my thoughts or process.

### Articles

Refined and researched: Articles are well-structured long-form pieces. Here, I share thorough perspectives and synthesized conclusions on topics I’ve spent time living with. If you're looking for deep dives and "big picture" ideas, start here. They will vary from technical pieces of the work I do, from robotics, AI, ML, RL, electronics (or any other field I get interested in) or some other personal thoughts or ideas about metaphysics,philosophy, psychology and patterns. Though I still would keep these non technical topics a little researched as I understand them.

### Projects

Building in public: Projects are collections of articles or technical walkthroughs centered around a specific build. These include code snippets, architectural decisions, and step-by-step write-ups of the things I create. Sometimes associated articles and series would also be included in projects as they become relevant to each other.


All said, this is a work in progress and I'm still exploring the best way to organize my writing. I'm open to any (literally) feedback and suggestions.
