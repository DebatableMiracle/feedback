Just watched this really sweet movie named Gifted.  I was kinda going for something fighty firy but idk just got this urge to watch this. 

I liked the movie honestly, a little funny and really one of my favourite things about life is that balance of what you're doing.. Evelyn is someone who maxed out her "math" part of life. While Frank (Evans) is being like the best human ever. Turns out he's a philosophy professor, he's not doing his best in life but he's doing the best for Mary. And I think it's quite important to live up to the "life" part of existing than just going for accolades and awards, papers and grades part of life. 

Although that is kinda what Im planning to do for the foreseeable future lol
