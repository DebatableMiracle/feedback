I have a couple ideas for next few articles I would wanna start with:
-  writing about consciousness and how modern AI imitates consciousness and the essence. How it might not be as different than us. Talk about how we barely understand human consciousness. 
- Write articles explaining DQN to SAC model free RL from scratch. Would be a good revision and practice for myself. 
- AI bubble is an interesting topic but I've to do research for that. Im really new to economics
- VLA model from scratch. I've been planning to build this one for some time
-  some linux cheatsheet for myself
- ROS journey
- new changes
