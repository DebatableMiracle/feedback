We often encounter these physics talk about what if we have higher dimensions of space and reality, though as a guy working in AI I encounter higher dimensionality everyday and physics makes it very scary in a way, optimization breaks on most of the higher dimension except some lucky anomalies like 8 and 24 etc. BUT, often working with tensors, it doesn't seem that scary. Dimensionality is just how something interacts and represents an object's property in a way? (specifically spacial) So sure if we can't see those dimensions we just don't understand the "Data", we fail to fit models. That's all. However we do understand some major aspects of our reality so the 3D space is enough to "survive". Getting higher information may even end up being redundant. There's surely a lot of things we can't accurately predict with lack of data, which is more obvious on quantum mechanics, where things ARE probabilistic which makes sense for higher dimensions existing but they are still predictable to some probabilities which is kinda comforting lol. Time is another dimension speaking mathematically. So, reality is kinda  stable lol.
