So, it's almost a month since I made this website. I also haven't updated much in the past couple of weeks due to busy schedule.

Here's some things I've been doing. 
- I have a couple articles, one about RT-1, one about VLA introductions, one about "What is You?" consciousness and sense of self things in drafts, none of them are finished but all of them are structured okay ishly and almost done. I need clean ups.
- Now to the point of why I have been busy? I am trying to be a bit more regular about myself. 
- I started gym, I'm prettyyyy skinny so working on that, the only sport I ever was good at was football sooo I have upper body of a twig, though working on that.
- I would be finished with my first research paper (I'm almost done already), submitting in IEEE TVT or LAWN, it's about drones and stuff. I have worked on research problem since my sophomore year but surprisingly don't have a paper. Luckily, I have also restarted that work since the professor wants to push that work to a patent. I am not very confident about it but heyy time works in weird ways.
- I have been working on my more fundamental skills, I am theoretically sound on a lot of things and empty on a lot of basics since I start working with building more than often missing some fundamentals which are obvious in "roadmaps" typa learning. Soo, doing some revision on basic ML, Linux, Python, C etc. not using chatgpt for anything. 
- I've been eating healthy, usually I'm either very lazy to eat orr too busy so this time, eating is part of the routine soo I don't miss out. Just wanna get to an average bodyweight and like NEYMARRR JR build lol (at 2017-18 era not like santos neymar types) I mean good body weight and some lean muscle that I can also play football with.
