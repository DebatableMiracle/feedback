I think the argument that Animals that are not able to see off their reflections in mirrors and not able to understand it is, indeed them by golly, means that they are not self-aware of self conscious is not the best representation.

Them not being able to understand the concept of reflection is way more about understanding about mirrors than being self aware or self conscious. 

(again not an original thought GPT suggests, just one that occured)
