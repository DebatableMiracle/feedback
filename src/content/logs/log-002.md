The website looks good and is deployed on vercel now which is great. I have few steps to go forward for the website, one is SEOs which I'm not really rushing for, since I probably don't even wanna share this *very*  publicly. Till it's refined a bit anyway.

More importantly my thought was to first, start syncing Obsidian notes with my phone to the PC. Since, I'd like logs to be spontaneous and instant, it doesn't make sense for me to get back to my room every time I think of something. Secondly, what I wanted to do is, automate the publishing system every time, there's a new post with published: true property. I am considering cron jobs or something similar and would try soon!
