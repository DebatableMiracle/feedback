The website looks good and is deployed on vercel now which is great. I have few steps to go forward for the website, one is SEOs which I'm not really rushing for, since I probably don't even wanna share this *very*  publicly. Till it's refined a bit anyway.

More importantly my thought was to first, start syncing Obsidian notes with my phone to the PC. Since, I'd like logs to be spontaneous and instant, it doesn't make sense for me to get back to my room every time I think of something. Secondly, what I wanted to do is, automate the publishing system every time, there's a new post with published: true property. I am considering cron jobs or something similar and would try soon!

Nextly, some important to-dos for the site would be:
- to add subtitles to the logs, making them more scannable from outside. and have a genre, and mini-description so that kinda helps readers.
- A fun idea would be to add a mood toggle to the site (a soul/system toggle) to switch into more technical to more personal topics. 
- Add status to the site footer or top like what I'm currently doing and engaged in. 
- Add a start here section or article and pin it but keeping it less cluttered and clean as it is now.
