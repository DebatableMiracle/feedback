mood: soul
project: movies

Watched this movie named Palm Springs and it involved a very interesting time loop. You enter this cave and voila you're now stuck in a time loop living the same day forever over and over. Andy Samberg makes this situation barable. And his idea was to just do stuff since no consequences, he doesn't try much to get out of it, unliike the girl, Sarah I guess? Who ends up studying quantum mechanics to get out of it leaving out some important details. But it's very much about depression, feeling stuck in a situation and well, coping and navigating through it and through life. Andy, like I would, decides to give up coz well is it worth all the effort, you can enjoy here, no consequences, just living the moment etc. Sarah, on the other hand, gets immensely depressed, finds Andy is the reason, falls in love, gets immensely depressed and like I would, decides to turn her life around because of how she hates her past self. It's about turning her life around. Which is great. Also with how good she got in Quantum Mechanics, she would actually be like greatest scientist ever and I can imagine it took 10 years of loop to actually understand it that much but it sounds like 10 days with how Andy was dealing with it.
