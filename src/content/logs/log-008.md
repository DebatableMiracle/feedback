I just realised writing might not be totally it? I like it and it's fun but if I do it like a target of a day it's becoming overwhelming and I'd like to tone it down a bit. Also gotta do my research work so would tone a bit down on the VLA article I'm currently working on rn but I'd try my best to be regular. It's kinda hard to be consistent for me as a person I think. I am kind of a person to work till the burn out hits, which gotta say not very ideal for long term projects. 

Anyways, who knew writing would be harder than writing romantic emails?
