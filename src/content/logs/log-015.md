So I'm done with my exams and am overwhelmed by all the things i wanna do

There's a lot of lot of work. I'll make different to do lists maybe?

I've to apply for masters and PHD too I'm pretty late since most are over and I've not really applied besides 2-3 and honestly a little panicked about it but tbh I wanna improve myself on these topics too. I'm not really at the level i wanna be with myself. So will work towards it.

Here's some checkpoints I would like to revisit
- [ ] Linux handyness improve to intermediate
- [ ] Python stuff basically OOPS and DSA, I never focused on this but should
- [ ] Core ML. I'm pretty good with hands-on work in ML but there's some fundamental basic stuff like even Random forest and stuff that i never really cared much about. All i know in depth are NNs. 
- [ ] Computer Vision/Deep learning for a soon to come interview 
- [ ] ROS2, I started learning but have a very high level overview.  Not handy
- [ ] VLA models! and end this with building one. from scratch. 
- [ ] and Core Electrical coz well I'm an Electrical Eng and filled out Electrical for my masters entrance

I hope I finish some of these by the end of the month lol. Most of them I'm very familiar with and need some rework so it shouldnt take time!
