I had a very weird day full of goodbyes somehow. Saying goodbyes has always felt a little odd to me. I lose my voice often around these. One of my closest friends dropping out of college, preparing to see one of my other closest friend moving abroad, and seeing some others packing bags for jobs. 

Somehow I'm not really sure what I'm gonna do while so many have already picked and that's a funny thing. Because I'm not really jealous of anyone, with even a slight of ambition I should feel a little bit bad with so many people around me being at better places but I don't really feel bad about that. All I probably want is to do and learn what I love and maybe find the path to become the roboticist or whatever it is that aligns with my idea of Ideal me. It feels like I spend way more time at "What I wanna do?" than actually doing anything about it. which sounds fair but slowed me down so much.
