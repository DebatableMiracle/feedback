I added another cool update to feedback. This time firstly, I used syncthing to sync the notes on my pc to phone so I can update everything on the go but more importantly.

I added a chokidar based automation that checks for the published toggle and on any change pushes the change to github. Which means automatic update on website from my phone or laptop Obsidian!

Test 1: 2 january 26, 01:01 am
Test 2: 2 january 26 01:56 am flag changed on pc, 01:57:01 am git push, almost instant vercel deployment after that
