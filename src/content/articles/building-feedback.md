# The need for logging

The initial idea for me was to log my thoughts etc to declutter myself from them. And I have quite varied interests varying from Reinforcement Learning, AI, AGI, Robotics, sometimes philosophy, psychology and how technology and these blend in with our coming future. A single blog place like medium didn't feel as structured and personal to me. At the same time, being an undergrad and working on different things, I don't think I'm committing to writing thorough posts every time. That's why I decided to give myself liberty with logs, short descriptive notes of thoughts I get, ideas. They're meant to be simplistic and just like a personal diary.

## Architecture

This site is built with:
- **Astro** 9
- **Markdown** 
- **Vercel** for hosting currently
- Giscus for comments
- and a lot of Antigravity

It is designed to be low-friction. I write in Obsidian, I commit to Git, it appears here.

### Logs vs Blogs

The distinction is important to me, because how I think Logs, are unpolished core of ideas over which I might decide to act possibly in 6 months. The finished product, is supposed to be my blog! (or article, I'm still working on it)

#### Updates: (jan 1)
I recently connected the repository content files to Syncthing and Obsidian on my phone which enables me to update the files nearly in real time (takes like a solid minute) But the idea is basically I don't have to run to my pc everytime I wanna write something down and it'll be updated in my code.
